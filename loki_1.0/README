In order to access paths defined in paths.php, some JavaScript files used by Loki must be
parsed with PHP. The js directory should have an .htaccess file with something to the effect
of the following:

<Files *.js>
ForceType application/x-httpd-php
</Files>

In addition, Loki files need to be web-available in some fashion. The LOKI_HTTP_PATH constant
defined in paths.php should reference either the web-available Loki directory, or a symbolic link
to Loki that is web-available.
