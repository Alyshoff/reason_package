/** 
 * Reason CMS loads this whenever tinyMCE is loaded. This defaults version does a couple things:
 *
 * - Fixes what is probably a bug with the lightgray theme which causes the format pull down to be too tall.
 * - Provides styles for our reasonimage and reasonlink plugins (soon)
 *
 * @todo move reasonimage and reasonlink CSS to this file

/* This seems to fix the format pull down height problem */
