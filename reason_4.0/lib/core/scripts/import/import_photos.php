	/**
	 * Bulk Image Import
	 *
	 * @package reason
	 * @subpackage scripts
	 *
	 * This script will run through a define directory( INCOMING_DIR ), and make Reason
	 * Image entities out of those images.  It will resize and make thumbnails as
	 * appropriate.
	 *
	 * TODO: Generalize this script for any site.
	 * [6/14/04] the only ID information needed by this script to perform correctly
	 * is the ID of the page to link to and the directory of the incoming images.
	 * If we standardize the incoming directory name, this script can work for
	 * any site.  All that needs to be passed in is the unique_name or id of the
	 * page to relate the images to.  My initial thought is to have a directory
	 * called incoming_photos, incoming_images, or just incoming in the base
	 * directory of a site similarly to how we treat .htaccess and test directories.
	 * To further slickify the system, we could have a bulk image import script
	 * that could drop in a zip file or a number of images into one of these
	 * directories and then import based on those files. -dh
	 *
	 * [12/13/2004] Added a form to populate all uploads with information specified.  Description, name, keywords,
	 * content, and datetime.
