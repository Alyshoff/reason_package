The FPDI PDF-Parser is a replacement of the PDF parser that is shipped
with FPDI by default. Just extract the content of this package to your
existing FPDI directory to overwrite the file pdf_parser.php and
extract additional files in the filters folder.


FOR EVALUATION VERSIONS ONLY
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
An evaluation package is encoded with Zend Safeguard or Ioncube.
Both versions requires a kind of loader to be installed on your
server.

An evaluation version is seperated into two parts: The PHP files
and a license file.

Licensefiles are named .htFPDI_PDF-Parser.icl or .htFPDI_PDF-Parser.zl

	NOTICE THE DOT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILENAME!
	SOME SYSTEMS (MAC) AUTOMATICALLY HIDE SUCH FILES!

Depending on the version you'd choosen read the
following installation instructions:


	Ioncube
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	The needed loaders and install instruction for the Ioncube Loader
	are available at: http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php
	
	Place the license file into the same directory of the
	pdf_parser.php file.
	

	Zend
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	To run Zend Guard encoded files you'll need the Zend Optimizer
	to be installed on your server. It is available for download at:
	http://www.zend.com/products/guard/downloads
	
	To load the license file you have to do this in your php code:
	
		zend_loader_install_license([absolute_path_to_the_licensefile], true);
	
	OR in your php.ini:
	
		zend_optimizer.licence_path = [path_to_the_licensefile]
		(make sure you restart your webserver)
